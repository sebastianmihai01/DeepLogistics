Self Driving Car using Python & Kivy (Also see section 'Technologies & Algorithms')

1. ai.py = neural network of the car (brain)

2. car.kv = kivy file to model the environment (car, balls ...)
   - Ball 1,2,3 are the sensors of the car
   - Game object - connects all the objects together (e.g. to glue the sensors to the car)

3. map.py = the main file of the project
          = the code that makes the entire environment

2.How do I train the car (to drive itself & avoid obstacles)
- Main goal: stick to the road
- Punish (negative reward) the car when it goes into the walls
